### Design Pattern Types

#### Creational Patterns
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

#### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter**: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrapper with a compatible interface.
- **Bridge**: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
- **Decorator**: Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects by wrapping them with a decorator object.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a complex subsystem.
- **Proxy**: Provides a placeholder or surrogate object to control access to another object.

#### Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects where a change in one object notifies its dependents.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing, or logging requests, and supporting undoable operations.

These design patterns provide solutions to common problems in software design and are categorized based on their purpose and structure. They promote code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability in software development projects.
