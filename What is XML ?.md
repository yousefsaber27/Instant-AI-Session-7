3. **Hierarchical Structure**: Organizes data in a tree-like structure.
4. **Custom Tags**: Allows creation of user-defined tags.

**Common Uses:**
- **Data interchange**: Facilitates data sharing across different systems and applications.
- **Configuration files**: Commonly used for configuration settings in software.
- **Web Services**: Used in SOAP and other web service protocols.
- **Documentation**: Often used for technical documentation formats like DITA.

**Example:**
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

**Disadvantages:**
- **Verbose**: Can result in large file sizes.
- **Performance**: Parsing XML can be slower compared to other formats like JSON.

**Conclusion:**
XML is a versatile and widely-used markup language ideal for a variety of applications requiring structured data representation and interchange. Its ability to define custom tags and its platform independence make it a powerful tool in many domains.
