Here's a brief overview of different types of databases and their typical uses:

| Database Type         | Description                                                                                                                                              | Typical Uses                                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Relational Database** | Organizes data into tables with rows and columns, and uses SQL for querying. Relationships between tables are defined by foreign keys.                   | Financial transactions, CRM systems, e-commerce platforms.        |
| **NoSQL Database**      | Provides a flexible schema design. It stores data in a non-tabular format, often using JSON-like documents or key-value pairs.                             | Big data applications, real-time web apps, IoT data storage.      |
| **Graph Database**      | Uses graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data. Optimized for managing and querying relationships between data entities. | Social networks, recommendation engines, network analysis.         |
| **Document Database**   | Stores data in flexible, semi-structured documents, like JSON or XML. Each document can have its own unique structure.                                      | Content management, catalog systems, real-time analytics.         |
| **Columnar Database**   | Optimizes storage and retrieval for data stored in columns rather than rows, enabling fast query performance and efficient compression.                    | Data warehouses, analytical processing, business intelligence.    |
| **Key-Value Store**     | Simplest database model, storing data as a collection of key-value pairs. Offers high performance for read and write operations.                             | Caching, session management, distributed data storage.            |
| **Time-Series Database**| Optimized for storing and analyzing timestamped data, such as IoT sensor data or log data.                                                                | IoT applications, monitoring systems, financial trading platforms. |
| **In-Memory Database**  | Stores data in main memory for faster data retrieval compared to disk-based databases.                                                                     | Caching, real-time data analytics, high-speed transaction processing. |

Each type of database is designed to address specific data storage, retrieval, and manipulation needs, tailored to different application requirements and use cases.
