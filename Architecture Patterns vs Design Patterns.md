| **Definition**                | This is a high-level structure of the entire system.               | This is a low-level solutions for common software design problems within components. |
| **Scope**                     | Broad, covers entire system.                                       | Narrow, focuses on individual components.                   |
| **Purpose**                   | Establish entire system layout.                                    | Provide reusable solutions for the recurring problems within a systemâ€™s implementation. |
| **Focus**                     | System stability, structural organization.                         | Behavioral and structural aspects within components.        |
| **Documentation**             | It involves architectural diagrams and high-level design documents. | It includes UML diagrams, detailed design specifications.   |
| **Examples**                  | Layered Architecture, Microservices, Client-Server.                | Singleton, Factory, Strategy, Observer.                     |
